version 2.27.91
  - Restore default window size that was changed with the netbook-mode
    merge.
  - Prevent the thumbview to shrink down to nothing when there are no
    items. Keep track of current items number and set a size request when
    it reaches zero.
  - Remove a bunch of hacks used in wide-mode switching to keep the video
    area size constant. Do everything in a more proper, non hackish, way.
    Fixes window "flickering" when switching to Wide Mode.
  - Restore a <schema> keyword that got lost in the gconf schema, fixes

version 2.27.90
  - Drop HILDON mode. We used to have HILDON support once but it has
    been broken for several major releases now. Better no support than
    a partial and broken one.

  - Merge netbook-mode branch. Introduces a new horizontal mode that
    fits nicely in small screens where the vertical real estate is
    limited (like netbooks). Commits summary follows.
  - Enable wide mode at startup if enabled in gconf or if forced
    through -w/--wide command line option. Save wide mode
    state in a gconf key.
  - Prevent icon view to shrink down when empty.
  - Let the thumbview pick up its optimal size. Remove hard coded size
    constraints for the icon view so that it picks up the best size
    for the current children (i.e. centered items, even with no
    selection, with every thumbnail size). Remove also extra
    spacing between and around thumbnails.
  - Correctly update thumbnav button sensitiveness. Force an update on
    up and down button sensitiveness while switching mode.
  - Keep size of the video preview area while switching mode. This way
    the icon view moves from the bottom to the right side while the
    rest of the window remains still.
  - Add UI for dynamically switching to and from wide mode.
    Add a WideMode action that triggers widget reparenting and changes
    spacing the vertical mode.
  - Add a function that sets the ThumbNav in vertical mode reparenting
    widgets on the fly.
  - Add a vertical mode for the ThumbNav. Add up and down buttons and
    implement vertical scrolling logic.
  - Reparent the icon view into the right aligment. First experiment
    of an horizontal mode suited for netbooks.
  - Make room for a vertical icon view in the right side. Add an hbox
    and an alignment to contain the icon view in the yet to come
    netbook mode.

  - Set WARNING MessageType for the InfoBar.
    Warning is certainly more suited since the missing webcam is not a fatal
    error. Also, the red color for the error type is really ugly. This
    lovely orange is much better.
  - Remove *.glade files.
    It is not recommended to use gtk-builder-convert anymore but to use
    glade-3 directly on the .ui files
  - Insensitize buttons and actions while "bursting".
  - Take the first photo of a burst right after button press. Rework a
    little bit burst mode to allow this.
  - Add 256x256 Cheese icons, courtesy of Ulisse Perusin.
  - Add tooltips to the buttons. Now that toolbar buttons have no
    labels tooltips can be helpful to identify each button role.
  - Add burst mode settings to preferences dialog. Allow to configure
    amount of photos to take in a burst and delay between each one.
  - Remove icon-size attribute of button icons. All icons have now the
    same size and honour gtk theme settings.
  - Add the scalable version of the take photo and burst icons.
  - Add --version command line flag.

  - post release version bump

version 2.27.5
  - add new photo and burst icons, courtesy of Ulisse Perusin
  - remove the label of the photo and video modes
  - support taking a series of photos, fixes bug #581997
    this introduces the burst mode in cheese.
    the burst mode allows to take a series of photos
    with a configurable delay and number of photos
  - Make webcam and resolution settings not sensitive if just 1 option
    is available. If there are no options to choose, make the webcam and
    resolution combo box insensitive, fixes bug #588353

version 2.27.4
  - bump gtk+ requirement to 2.17.3
  - ensure the drawing area has a native X11 window
    With the new client-side-window gtk+ widgets do not always have a
    native window anymore. We need an XID to give to GstXOverlay and embed
    video into the application. This temporarily works around the issue
    forcing a native window. Works around bug 588357
  - use the camera-web icon instead of camera-video
    we are using camera-web in the project logo/icon but camera-video for the
    UI. it is more appropriate to use the camera-web icon as it's a) less
    likely people will use camcorders with cheese b) there is bigger visual
    distinction between camera-photo and camera-web than camera-photo and
    camera-video.
  - manually expose the window if not PLAYING
    Draw a black background if the pipeline is starting up and the overlay
    is still not ready to expose the drawing area.
  - fix broken xoverlay management
    For some reason this went unnoticed for a long time. We were calling
    set_x_overlay right after setting PLAYING state (with no warranty that
    the state change succeeded nor that an overlay was really there). The
    only right way to do this is to wait for prepare-xwindow-id message. It
    worked until now just because we've been extremely lucky.
  - drop url and email handlers
    Drop url and email handlers used in the about dialog since gtk+ 2.17.2
    already provides that functionality built in.
  - drop GEditMessageArea in favor of GtkInfoBar
    Drop GEditMessageArea since it recently entered gtk+. Fixes bug #586545
  - use AM_SILENT_RULES if available, fixes bug #587581
  - Use accessor functions instead direct access, fixes bug #585210
  - remove markup from translatable strings
  - keybindings: add configure checks for needed X11 stuff
    Check for XF86keysym.h availability and add a configure option to
    disable Webcam Button listening. Copied from rhythmbox.
  - add little program to emit fake webcam button events
  - capture webcam buttons
    Listen to XF86Webcam keypresses to capture webcam buttons. Should
    work with every driver that correctly binds the input device to
    KEY_CAMERA events. Fixes bug #521551
  - remove padding from the take_picture button
    Use alignment xscale property instead of padding in the take_picture
    button. Doesn't fix but at least partly works around bug #573301 (the
    button can now grow up and fill the whole free space with no padding
    constraint).
  - sanitize main toolbar structure
    No real change, just some little restructuring of the glade toolbar
    definition to make it easier to hack on.

version 2.27.3
  - Set default resolution to the highest one with a non jerky (higher than
    15fps) framerate, fixes bug #585857
  - Lower max-delay and max-page-delay oggmux properties from 5 to 0.5
    seconds. Should prevent out of sync audio in recorded videos and
    hopefully fix bug #585761
  - Don't access effects string after free. This was causing the first effect
    stored in gconf to not be restored at startup, fixes bug 584186
  - Get rid of GtkAspectFrame, it doesn't really suit our needs, it hardcodes
    an aspect ratio that obviously cannot be valid for every format webcams
    support. Render the video directly to the drawing area with no external
    aspect ratio restriction. Eventually fixes bug #559188 since the
    aspectframe was adding some extra padding between the video and the window
    border.
  - Almost every available gstreamer videosink can display black bars around
    the video keeping its aspect ratio. Enable it if available.
    Black bars look a lot nicer than the grey color of the underlying
    gtkwindow displayed with the aspectframe.
  - Properly forward expose events to GstXOverlay.
  - Avoid ugly flickering on window resize. Let gstxoverlay take full control
    of the drawing area window. Prevent gtk from drawing the background and
    remove the flickering caused by its internal double buffering.
  - Remove initial black bars (at least for 4:3 webcams). Set a default window
    size that fits nicely the video aspect ratio so that black bars are not
    drawn until a manual resize.

version 2.27.2
  - Ignore new photo requests if we are still waiting for an "handoff" signal
    for the previous one, fixes bug #582902
  - Fix a couple of trivial memory leaks in the thumbnail generator code, fixes
    bug #578289
  - Don't return if "image-loading" icon is not found, we will have an empty
    pixbuf while the thumbnail thread is running but it is surely better than
    no thumbnail at all, fixes bug #582240

version 2.26.0
  - Lock gdk mutex in photo-saved and video-saved callbacks Those signals are emitted
    within a gstreamer callback so outside the mainloop, hence the need for locking.

    right after the flash, fixes bug #566098
