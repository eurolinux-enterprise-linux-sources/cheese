Take photos and videos with your webcam, with fun graphical effects

The official website is:

How to get your camera working:
To get your camera working with cheese, you will have to ensure that it works
with the Gstreamer Framework and Video4Linux2 (V4L2) or Video4Linux (V4L). To
test this, you can use the 'gstreamer-properties' tool.

Sharing images and videos:
In order to be able to share images and videos from Cheese, you will need to
install the 'nautilus-sendto' package first. In case you try to use the sharing
functionality and nautilus-sendto is not installed, PackageKit will be used in
order to install it at runtime.
